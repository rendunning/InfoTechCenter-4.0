#INFO TECH CENTER 4.1
This system mimics what a car's computer may say on startup. The InfoTechCenter first welcomes the user and mimics a loading screen, the loading is simply an asthetic choice because the computer is not actually loading anything. After a couple seconds the system will then pretend to look at the weather and "adjust" the maximum speed of the car depending on certain conditions. Next, the system will pretend to check the gas level of the car and randomly assign an amount, then the system will choose a random gas station from a list and use a random number to detail how close the station is to the car. This could be replaced with a sensor to detect a gas level and a gps conncetion to determine the real-time gas station locations.
